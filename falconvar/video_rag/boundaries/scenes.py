"""Scene evidence: content scores, thresholded into cuts.

Its own pass over the picture, so the grid is an input to ingest rather than
something ingest derives while consuming it.

Converts lazily -- straight to the detection size through the decoder's own
scaler, never building a full-resolution frame.

The detector scores the difference between *consecutive frames it was given*,
so a stride widens the gap between them and a threshold calibrated for adjacent
frames fires far more often. Every real cut survives a stride; false positives
rise. The stride is therefore a parameter and the threshold moves with it.

`cuts.json` records the per-frame score series, not just the cuts, so a
different threshold is arithmetic over a cached array instead of another pass.
`cuts_from_scores` is that cheap half and both `detect` and `rethreshold` call
it, so a retune and a re-run cannot disagree.
