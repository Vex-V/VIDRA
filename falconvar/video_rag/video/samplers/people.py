    """People, compared by appearance.

    YOLO locates each person, CLIP embeds each person *crop*, and the crop
    embeddings are compared. Cropping before embedding is the point: a full
    frame is resized to 224x224 and centre-cropped before CLIP sees it, so a
    person occupies roughly one patch and their detail is gone. A crop is
    *upsampled* to 224 instead, so posture, orientation and held objects
    survive into the vector -- which is how a person standing perfectly still
    who starts reading their phone registers as a change.

    No identity tracking. At 1 fps a walking person moves several times their
    own box width between frames, so IoU-based trackers cannot associate them.
    Comparing sets sidesteps identity and still catches what box comparison
    cannot: one person leaving as another arrives elsewhere.

    The score is a minimum over people, so it falls as headcount rises purely
    as an order statistic -- median 0.949 for one to three people against
    0.856 for eight or more. Crowded frames therefore sample more;
    ``min_interval_s`` is the practical control. Threshold 0.83 was calibrated
    against a person-crop median of 0.907.
