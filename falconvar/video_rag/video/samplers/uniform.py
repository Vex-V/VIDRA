"""Positional sampling: every Nth decimated frame.

**A stride over what the sampler was actually offered**, counted in
`chunk_local_index` -- the frame's position in its chunk's decimated stream and
the only thing about position a sampler is handed. A sampler answers yes or no
about the frame in front of it; counting the frames it was offered keeps the
decision inside what flows past it, where reaching for a wall of media time to
divide does not.

The cadence in seconds is therefore a consequence of decimation rather than a
second setting beside it: `every_n=3` is one frame every 3 s at
`per_second=1` and one every 0.75 s at 4. That is the point -- `per_second`
already decides how much of the video anything downstream may look at, so a
positional sampler is a stride over what survived it. A cadence in seconds
regardless is still expressible, through `min_interval_s`, which the base class
enforces for every sampler alike.

The default is 1: every decimated frame. There is no separate `overview`
sampler -- `overview` is a *prompt*, and every sampler takes one.
