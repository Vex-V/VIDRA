    The score is the *weakest best match*, taken in one direction only: for
    each region visible now, how well does it match anything in the reference
    frame; the worst of those is the score. Direction matters more than it
    looks. A detector that momentarily loses something and finds it again
    produces a region that matches its own earlier self, so nothing fires.
    Scoring the reverse direction too would treat every dropout as a
    departure, which on busy footage is most frames. Consequence: regions
    leaving does not trigger a sample; regions arriving or changing does.

    Region *count* is deliberately never a trigger. On checkout footage the
    person count changed on roughly half of all frame pairs at every
    confidence threshold tried, and raising confidence to suppress it simply
    lost real people. Counting is not a change signal on busy footage.
