"""The sampler contract.

A sampler sees the decimated stream one frame at a time and answers yes or no.
It cannot look ahead, revisit a frame it declined, or buffer the chunk.

Three things live here rather than in each strategy:

    min_interval_s  smallest gap between two kept frames
    max_per_chunk   ceiling on frames kept from one chunk
    prompts         which questions describe should ask about these frames

The rate limits short-circuit before `propose` runs, so a rate-limited frame
costs no inference. Every chunk keeps at least one frame.

`prompts` is on the base class, so any strategy pairs with any number of
questions -- `uniform:text` reads the screen on a stride, `clip:[text,scene]`
asks two questions of one set of frames. Selecting frames is the expensive
half and asking about them is the cheap one, so a sampler runs **once** per
distinct configuration however many questions it carries. Unpaired, the
question is the sampler's own name.

Nothing here reads a prompt: they are opaque strings, validated by whoever
built the sampler, because a sampler knowing the prompt registry would be an
edge from ingest to describe.
