    Objects have no state the way people do. Measured on real footage, the
    same object one second later scores 0.989 CLIP similarity and has moved
    half a pixel, so an appearance embedding carries almost no signal while
    costing a forward pass per detection. What changes is whether a thing is
    there and where.

    Detection uses an open vocabulary because COCO's classes do not contain
    the objects most footage is actually about -- plain YOLO found seven
    non-person classes on checkout video, dominated by ``bench`` and
    ``suitcase`` at ~0.30 confidence, both of which were the same empty
    counter. Matching is class-aware, so a cart never counts as a bag.
