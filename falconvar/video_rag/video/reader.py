"""Sequential decode, converting only the frames something asked for.

Decoding a frame costs ~0.4 ms; converting it to a full-resolution BGR array
costs ~6 ms. Ingest needs pixels only for frames that survive decimation, and
the decimator answers from `media_ts` alone -- so its verdict is asked *before*
the conversion and most frames never become an array.

Sequential rather than seeking: frames reference each other, so producing the
frame at second 47 means decoding forward from its keyframe regardless.

A generator, so exactly one frame is in flight. `Frame.image` is borrowed and
released as soon as the frame is not needed; anything outliving the loop copies.

Rotation comes from OpenCV because PyAV 18.1 exposes the display matrix through
none of `side_data`, `rotation`, `display_matrix` or `metadata`.
