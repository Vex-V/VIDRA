"""One decode pass, feeding every sampler from it.

Per frame: decimate on media time, ask the grid which chunk this is, reset the
samplers at a boundary, offer the frame to each, release the pixels.

The grid is an input and is never edited -- this asks `timeline.nearest(ts)`
and nothing else. No boundary is derived, corrected or merged here, which is
why nothing needs a streaming chunker.
