"""`describe()` -- one call per (chunk, sampler).

**Every (chunk, sampler) pairing is independent.** A call's schema is a
function of its question alone, so two questions that share a field both answer
it and both answers are kept under their own sampler id. Nothing is reconciled
and nothing is dropped.

**So the calls run concurrently.** Every call is planned first, in manifest
order, and its slot in the document reserved; then one task per (chunk, sampler
run) reads that run's frames once and asks its questions. `describer.concurrency`
caps the runs in flight, which bounds the frames held in memory as well as the
calls. The document comes out in manifest order however the calls finish.

**Resume is keyed on the manifest, the describer, and the prompts.** A stored
description counts as done only if all three match. Without the describer
check, running with the stub and then switching to a real one skips every pair
and reports success having done nothing -- the most expensive kind of silent
no-op, since the output looks complete. The prompts need their own key for the
same reason: editing an instruction changes the answer but not the model id.

**The prompt key is a hash per question, not one over the vocabulary.** A
single hash also invalidated answers that could not have changed, so adding a
question re-described every chunk of every video and the next run silently paid
for it. `model.prompts` is `{question: hash}` and `_resumable` compares each
pair against its own question.
