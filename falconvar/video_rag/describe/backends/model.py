"""The describer: frames in, one structured answer out, from any chat model.

A ``Describer``, so the reader neither knows nor cares which provider answers
or whether the call crosses a network. Everything it needs arrives in
``describe(images, context)``; which provider, and how that provider is asked
for a shape, is `shared/models/llm.py`'s business.

The frames are already JPEG in hand -- ``FrameStore.read_bytes`` hands them
over exactly as ingest wrote them -- so the stored bytes are sent as they are.
No decode, no resize, no re-encode. That is deliberate beyond efficiency: at
1024 px a VLM misread a burnt-in clock as 11:17:40 when it read 11:17:19 and
got it right at 1920, so the store is written at full width and nothing
downstream is allowed to quietly shrink it.

Cost is per image, and the reader calls this once per (chunk, sampler) pair
with every frame that sampler kept. On the reference run that is 10 calls
carrying 105 images for 80 distinct frames -- samplers overlap, and a frame
chosen by two of them is deliberately described twice, once per question.

The model must accept images. Nothing here can tell a vision model from a
text one before the call; the provider's refusal is passed through.
