"""A describer that loads nothing.

Deliberately obvious in its output. `falconvar` learned why: a form defaulting
to the alphabetically-first option produced a complete-looking run whose
content was `[stub0.0][stub0.1]`, and nothing was wrong enough to report.

It still fills the *same keys* a real describer would for this question, so a
stub run exercises the shape the document has to hold rather than a simpler one.
