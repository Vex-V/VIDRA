"""The field builder: a compact field spec in, JSON Schema out.

`{"severity": {"type": "text", "one_of": [...]}}` becomes the schema a
structured model call is sent. Generated rather than accepted: the call goes
out with `strict: true`, whose subset is narrow, and a raw schema arriving over
HTTP could express something the API refuses -- failing *after* the frames are
read, with the call about to be paid for.

**Shared because an answer is not only a describe answer.** A describe shape
and an aggregate prompt both declare their fields this way and both compile
through here, which is why `check_fields` was already written apart from
`check_shape`. Keeping it in `describe` meant `aggregates` reached a video_rag
component to build its own schemas.

The caps travel with the checker that enforces them: structured answers run
~3x longer than prose, and the `people` schema truncated into unparseable JSON
at 700 output tokens.
