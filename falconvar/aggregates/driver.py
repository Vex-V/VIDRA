"""The aggregates driver: what video_rag extracted -> `aggregates/<answer>.json`.

Each answer writes its own file, so a run that dies partway leaves the results
it did produce rather than none -- the same reason tiers run cheapest first.

**An answer is one aggregator over one input.** `summary` over its default
input is `summary.json`. `--input summary=clip:hazards[severity],clip:hazards[hazards]`
is two answers, `summary~severity` and `summary~hazards`. A link profile's id
carries a colon, `entities:people`, and Windows refuses one in a filename, so on
disk it is `entities.people.json`.

**Reads the other tier's files, and asks it exactly one thing.** Documents are
read straight from disk through `shared`, the field builder and the renderer
and the embedder are `shared` too, and the whole-video vector is written here.
The single call into `video_rag.driver` is `vocabulary()` -- what a question or
a sampler may be named -- imported inside the function that needs it, so
importing this package loads nothing from the other tier.
