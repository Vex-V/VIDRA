"""aggregates -- higher-level answers over what video_rag extracted.

The second tier. Reads the documents video_rag wrote, through video_rag's
driver -- never the video, and never a video_rag component. Answers the
questions embeddings cannot: counts, coverage, who dominated, how much of this
is speech, what the whole video is about, who is who across chunks.

Three tiers, cheapest first. `free` is arithmetic, `local` adds GPU models,
`llm` adds paid calls. Both dear tiers are registered lazily, so importing this
pulls in neither torch nor an API client and needs no key.

Two sources of aggregators. Code: `stats`, `speakers`, `coverage`, `ner`,
`sentiment`. Data: every prompt and link profile in `definitions` -- `summary`,
`chapters`, `events`, `entities:people` and whatever a user has added -- each run
by its kind's runner.

**One folder per aggregator, each with a `driver.py`**, as a component of
video_rag has. A tier is a class attribute rather than a directory, because it
says what an aggregator *costs*, not what it is made of -- and grouping by cost
put `linking`, which is 230 lines of its own, three levels from the runner that
is its only caller. What every aggregator shares is `base` (the protocols and
`DefinitionRunner`), `inputs` (what it reads) and `rendering` (how that reads).
