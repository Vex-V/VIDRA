"""The `link` kind: the same person or thing across chunks, and an account of each.

A link profile says which field, which keys identify an entry of it, how alike
two entries are measured, and what to write. Identity is decided by `linking`
-- embeddings and closed-vocabulary attributes under rules, no model.
The model is asked only afterwards, once per linked entity and concurrently, to
write the profile's account from that entity's observations. This is v0's
flow, cluster then narrate, with v0's fixed threshold replaced by the rules.

**The check flags; it never drops.** With `check: flag` the same call names
observations that contradict the rest. They stay in the entity, marked with the
reason, and the account is written from the others. Measured as a filter that
removed them, the check caught the known bad merge (dark puffy coat against a
cream coat) but also rejected true matches, treating a detail absent from one
observation as a contradiction: F1 fell 0.03 to 0.13, and the same prompt
rejected three observations on one run and four on the next. Flagged, a doubt
cannot corrupt the account and cannot cost a true link either.

Also answered here, because they fall out of the linking for free: how long
each entity was in shot, and which entities were in shot together.
