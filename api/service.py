"""The pipeline in terms a request can supply.

Every component has the same signature, so `COMPONENTS` is a dispatch table
rather than one function per stage and a single route serves all of them.

Nothing here does pipeline work: it resolves names to callables, validates
against the registries, and reads what is on disk.

`available()` reads the registries and the defaults off `workflow.Options`, so
a sampler or an index added to the package appears in `/capabilities` without
anyone editing a list -- and a form built from it cannot default to whichever
