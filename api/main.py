"""The HTTP surface over the pipeline.

Three shapes of route:

    immediate  reading what exists, and searching
    queued     anything that decodes, transcribes or pays a model: a 202 with
               a job id, and the caller polls
    uniform    `POST /videos/{id}/run/{component}` runs any component, because
               every one of them is `run(video_id, ...) -> Produced`

`browse.router` adds a fourth thing to read: the rows themselves, filtered and
paged, which is the question shape a whole-document download cannot answer.
`web/` is mounted at `/app` when it exists -- static files, no build step,
generating every form from `/capabilities` rather than restating it.

`workflow.validate` answers synchronously, so a contradictory request is a 422
rather than a job that fails a minute later. `docs/ROUTES.md` records the rest
of the reasoning; `/docs` is the authority on shapes.
