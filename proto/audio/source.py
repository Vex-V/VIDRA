"""The waveform, decoded once, whole.

PyAV rather than an ffmpeg subprocess: one decoder, one set of timestamp
semantics, no second binary to check for. Resampling happens inside the decode
loop -- 16 kHz mono float32, what both Whisper and pyannote want.

The whole file is held at once, which is the price of transcription being a
whole-file operation. At 16 kHz mono that is 64 KB per second, so an hour is
230 MB.
