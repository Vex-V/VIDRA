    """Samples once the scene has changed enough to be worth describing.

    Each decimated frame is embedded and compared by cosine similarity. A
    frame is kept when similarity falls *below* ``threshold`` -- high
    similarity means nothing happened, so nothing is sampled. Within a chunk a
    static scene therefore yields the opening frame and nothing more.

    Two comparison modes, and the difference matters:

      ``reference``   -- compare against the last frame that was *kept*.
                         Change accumulates, so a slow pan eventually trips
                         the threshold. This is what deduplication wants.
      ``consecutive`` -- compare against the previous frame it evaluated.
                         Only detects instantaneous change; a slow pan never
                         trips it however far the scene travels.

    ``min_interval_s`` suppresses frames before they are embedded, so in
    ``consecutive`` mode "the previous frame" means the previous frame the
    sampler was allowed to look at, not the previous decimated frame.

    Threshold is video-dependent and must be measured. On the reference
    footage consecutive-frame similarity sits at p50 0.989 with sensor noise
    manufacturing false samples above ~0.97, leaving a usable window of
    roughly 0.94-0.97; 0.96 is the default.
