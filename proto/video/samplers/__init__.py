"""Sampling strategies, addressable by name.

A name here is a *strategy* -- which frames to keep -- and nothing more. What
is asked about those frames is a prompt, paired as `name:prompt` and accepted
by every sampler, so there is no entry here for a question. `falconvar` had an
`overview` sampler whose entire content was `prompt="overview"`; it is spelled
`uniform:overview` now, and any other sampler can ask it too.

Model-backed samplers are resolved lazily. Importing this package must not pull
in torch, ultralytics or easyocr: the positional baseline has to stay usable,
and testable, on a machine with none of them installed.
