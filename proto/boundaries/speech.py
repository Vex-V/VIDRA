"""Speech evidence: cuts from a finished transcript.

    vad       cut in the middle of a silence longer than `silence_s`
    speaker   cut where the voice changes

The middle of a gap rather than either edge: a boundary at the end of speech
clips a trailing word the model placed slightly late, and one at the start of
the next clips its first.

Consecutive turns by one speaker are not a boundary, which stops a pause inside
someone's answer becoming a chunk edge. A recording with one voice offers no
speaker cuts and returns none rather than failing.

Neither applies a guard: `grid.enforce` owns `min_s` so it means the same thing
under every policy.
