"""Evidence plus a duration, into spans.

The only place boundaries are decided. `uniform` needs no evidence at all --
it is arithmetic over the container duration.

Both guards are mandatory for a content-derived policy. Voice activity cuts on
every pause, which would shred the video into chunks too short to describe; a
monologue yields zero cuts and one chunk covering the file. `min_s` merges,
`max_s` splits.

`max_s` splits evenly, not into fixed bites: 30 s bites off a 62.5 s span leave
a 2.5 s remainder, so a guard against short chunks would create one.
