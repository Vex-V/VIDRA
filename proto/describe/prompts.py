"""What to ask about a chunk, and what shape to expect back.

Logic only. The instructions, response schemas and shapes are data, in
`prompts.json` beside this file and `data/prompts.json` for anything added
since -- `library.py` merges the two.

A question resolves to a **shape**, and the shape decides the schema. Nothing
else does: a (sampler, question) pairing is independent of every other pairing
on the chunk, so `schema_for` is a function of the question alone and two
questions that share a field both answer it.

Any sampler may be paired with any question. The vocabulary is validated before
a run rather than fallen through: an unknown name would otherwise quietly get
the general question and bill for it.
