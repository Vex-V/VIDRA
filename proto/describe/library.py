"""The prompt vocabulary: built-in questions, plus whatever a user has added.

Two files, and the split is the point:

    falconvar/video_rag/describe/prompts.json   built in, shipped, read-only at runtime
    data/prompts.json                 custom, written by the API

Custom entries layer on top and may not shadow a built-in, so a request can
never change what a shipped question asks -- the alternative is a deployment
whose `yolo` means something different from every other one, with nothing in
the repo saying so.

A question is an instruction and a **shape**. The shape is where the response
schema lives, and a question either names a shipped shape or brings its own --
`yolo` is not a special case in the code, it is the `people` shape.

A shape is just a set of fields. The one marked `fallback` is what an
unrecognised question resolves to; it has no other privilege. Two questions
whose shapes share a field both answer it, and both answers are kept, because
a (sampler, question) pairing is independent of every other pairing on the
chunk.

**A custom shape is built, never accepted.** `fields` is a small builder --
`text` or `list`, plus `of` for a list of objects and `one_of` for a fixed
vocabulary -- and `compile_shape` generates the JSON Schema from it. The schema
reaches the model API with `strict: true`, whose subset is narrow, so a raw
schema arriving over HTTP could express something the API refuses and the
failure would land after the frames are read with the call about to be paid
for. The builder spans exactly the range the shipped shapes already use:
verified by rebuilding all five from their own field lists, identical.

A custom shape is stored under its question's name and dies with it. It may
not take a shipped shape's name -- `people` and `prose` are shape names that
are *not* question names, so the question-level shadow guard does not cover
them -- and it can never claim `fallback`, because exactly one shape is what
every unrecognised question resolves to and it is a shipped one.

**Which keys identify an entry is not a shape's business.** It used to be
declared beside the shapes, for entity linking; a link profile in
`falconvar/aggregates/definitions/definitions.json` owns it now, so the same answers can be
linked by different keys without touching what was asked.
