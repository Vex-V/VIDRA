# Routes

The HTTP surface is `api/`, over `falconvar`. Run it with:

    python -m uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000

[`/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs) is the generated schema and is the
authority on request and response shapes -- with
[`/redoc`](http://localhost:8000/redoc) and
[`/openapi.json`](http://localhost:8000/openapi.json) the same thing rendered
differently. This file records the reasoning the schema cannot carry.
[`/`](http://localhost:8000/) redirects to [`/app/`](http://localhost:8000/app/)
when `web/` is present and to `/docs` when it is not -- decided from the
directory rather than assumed, since a redirect to a mount that does not exist
is a 404 that reads as breakage.

**Every link below assumes `--port 8000`.** Change the port in the command and
the links no longer point at your server.

## Three shapes of route

**Immediate** -- reading what exists, and searching. Milliseconds.

*Reading the rows is a fourth thing, added later and kept in `browse.py`:
`/videos/{id}/artifacts/{name}` hands over a whole document, which is the right
shape for a download and the wrong one for a question.*

**Queued** -- anything that decodes, transcribes or pays a model. A 202 with a
job id, and the caller polls. Slow work runs **one job at a time**: every heavy
stage contends for the same 8 GiB GPU, so two videos at once does not halve the
wall clock, it doubles the resident weights.

**Uniform** -- `POST /videos/{id}/run/{component}` runs *any* component,
because every one of them is `run(video_id, ...) -> Produced`. A route and a
handler per stage is what the uniform signature removes: adding a component
adds a row to `service.COMPONENTS` and this route already serves it.

## The endpoints

| method | path | |
|---|---|---|
| GET | [`/health`](http://localhost:8000/health) | liveness, and how many jobs are queued |
| GET | [`/capabilities`](http://localhost:8000/capabilities) | every registry, plus the defaults read off `workflow.Options` |
| POST | `/videos` | upload a file and queue the whole pipeline. **202** |
| POST | `/videos/{id}/run/{component}` | queue one component. **202** |
| GET | [`/jobs`](http://localhost:8000/jobs) | every job this process remembers |
| GET | `/jobs/{job_id}` | one job: state, stage, history, stats |
| GET | [`/videos`](http://localhost:8000/videos) | every video with an output directory |
| GET | `/videos/{id}` | what this video has, with URLs |

| GET | `/prompts/{name}` | one question, with the schema a call would get |
| POST | `/prompts` | add a custom question. **201** |
| DELETE | `/prompts/{name}` | remove a custom one. **204** |
| GET | [`/aggregate-definitions`](http://localhost:8000/aggregate-definitions) | every aggregate prompt and link profile, and the input grammar |

| DELETE | `/aggregate-prompts/{name}` | remove a custom one. **204** |
| POST | `/link-profiles` | add a custom link profile. **201** |
| DELETE | `/link-profiles/{name}` | remove a custom one. **204** |
| POST | `/search` | scope is a set of videos; `level` picks moment or video |
| GET | [`/db/status`](http://localhost:8000/db/status) | can this deployment read Postgres, and what is in it |
| GET | [`/db/tables`](http://localhost:8000/db/tables) | every table, what it holds, its deployed columns |
| POST | `/db/query` | one page of one table: filters, order, offset, count |
| GET | [`/app/`](http://localhost:8000/app/) | the web client. `/` redirects here |

The linked rows are the GETs that take no parameters, so a browser can open
them as they stand. The rest cannot be followed: a path with `{id}` needs a
real video id substituted, and every `POST` and `DELETE` needs a body. Use
[`/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs) -- each operation has a **Try it out**
button -- or `curl`:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/videos
curl -s http://localhost:8000/videos/Chernobyl/artifacts/media
curl -s http://localhost:8000/videos/Chernobyl/frames/125 -o frame.jpg

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/db/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"table": "chunks", "limit": 5}'
```

## Every route, in and out

`/docs` remains the authority on exhaustive field lists and types -- it is
generated from the code and cannot drift. What follows is the shape a caller
actually needs: what to send, what comes back, and which failures are
*expected* rather than a bug. `?` marks an optional field.

Every error is `{"detail": {...}}` with an `error` string, and a `known` list
wherever the thing you named has a fixed set of alternatives.

### GET /health

    out   {ok: true, queued: 0}

`queued` is the depth of the one background worker. Liveness plus the only
number that says whether a submitted job will start now or wait.

### GET /capabilities

    out   {components[], samplers[], prompts[], shapes[], pairings[],
           policies[], describers[], embedders[], llms[], databases[],
           transcribers[], diarizers[], tiers[],
           aggregators: {name: {tier, about, kind, reads}},  -- kind null for code
           aggregate_inputs: {default, grammar[{syntax, reads}]},
           artifacts:   {name: about},
           parameters:  {component: [{name, type, default, required}]},
           defaults:    {policy, sampler, tier, database,
                         describer, llm, embedder},    -- each provider/model
           models:      {providers: [{name, protocol, about, builtin, local,
                                      chat, embed, chat_model, embed_model,
                                      base_url, key_vars[], structured,
                                      concurrency, configured, why}],
                         problems[], file, env: {role: variable}},
           search:      {filters[], structured_fields{}, levels[]}}

The contract a client generates itself from. `parameters` is read off each
component's signature and `defaults` off `workflow.Options`, so neither can
drift from what the code takes. `search.structured_fields` lists only the
fields a shape fixed with `one_of` -- the only ones worth offering as a filter.

The three model defaults are resolved **now** -- `FALCONVAR_*` from `.env`,
then `openai` -- and given as `provider/model`, rather than read off the
dataclass, whose model fields are `None` until a run resolves them. `models.providers` says which
providers can run here: `configured` is a key found, or a provider on this
machine that needs none; `why` names the variable to set otherwise. It carries
the *names* of key variables and never a value. A local server is not pinged,
so `configured` there means "no key needed", not "up". `problems` lists
`data/providers.json` entries that were dropped, and why.

Note `components` lists all nine including `media`, and `media` is the one the
run route below refuses: until it has run there is no id to address.

### POST /videos

Multipart, not JSON -- it carries a file.

    in    file (required), run?=true, video_id?, policy?, sampler?,
          use_video?, use_audio?, tier?, database?,
          describer?, embedder?, llm?
    out   run=true   202 {job: {...}, video_id}
          run=false  201 {video_id, media: {...Produced}, next, components[]}
    422   workflow.validate found a contradiction: {"problems": [...]}

`run=false` runs `media` and stops, which is what makes the video addressable;
it is answered rather than queued because it is a container probe. The id comes
from the filename, sanitised -- not from the client.

`describer`, `embedder` and `llm` each take a provider or `provider/model`
(`ollama/gemma3:4b`, `local/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`); blank resolves as
`/capabilities.defaults` shows. Every role this run will use is checked before
anything is queued -- an unknown provider, one that cannot do the job
(`anthropic` serves no vectors), no model, or no key is a 422 naming it, not a
job that fails after the video is decoded. `describer` is only checked when the
run reads the picture, `llm` only at `tier=llm`.

### POST /videos/{video_id}/run/{component}

    in    {params: {...}}          whatever that component takes
    out   202 {job: {id, kind, video_id, state, stage, detail, result, error,
                     queued_at, started_at, finished_at, elapsed_s, history[]}}
    404   unknown component (with `known`), or the video was never uploaded

`aggregate` is the exception: its `inputs` (`{aggregator: selection}`, or
`name=selection;...`), `only` and `tier` are validated before queueing, so a
field a question does not have is a 422 naming the fields it does.

Otherwise `params` is passed through as keyword arguments and only the component
validates it, so an unknown parameter name is a `TypeError` inside the job --
202 first, then a failed job -- and a known parameter the chosen branch does
not read is silently ignored. `/capabilities.parameters` is the list; the
document a stage writes records what was actually applied.

### GET /jobs · GET /jobs/{job_id}

    out   /jobs      {jobs: [{...}], queued, note}
          /jobs/{id} {id, kind, video_id, state, stage, detail, result, error,
                      queued_at, started_at, finished_at, elapsed_s, history[]}
    404   no such job -- records die with the process

`state` is `queued | running | done | failed`. **`stage` is what is RUNNING and
`history` what has FINISHED**: the workflow announces each component twice, once
by name before it runs, because a stage set only on completion names the
*previous* component throughout the longest step of a run. `detail` is the last
`Produced`; on a failure it carries the traceback instead.

A job id is a 12-character hex string, not a video id.

### GET /videos · GET /videos/{video_id}

    out   /videos      {videos: [{video_id, artifacts[], duration_s, has_video,
                                  has_audio, policy, chunks,
                                  timeline_fingerprint}]}
          /videos/{id} {video_id, documents[{name, about, url}],
                        aggregates[{name, about, url}], frames}
    404   no such video

Read from disk, not remembered, so a restarted server still lists everything it
produced. `has_video`/`has_audio` are how a caller knows which stages apply
before queueing one that cannot run. `documents` and `aggregates` hold **only
what exists**: `frames` is `null` until a store is written, because a link that
404s reads as breakage rather than as a stage that never ran.

### GET /videos/{video_id}/artifacts/{name}

    in    name: media | raw_transcript | cuts | timeline | manifest |
                transcript | descriptions | embedded        ?download=1
    out   the document, verbatim -- the same JSON the run wrote to disk
    404   unknown artifact name (with `known`), or that stage has not run

`?download=1` only adds a `Content-Disposition`; the body is identical. Content
negotiation would be tidier, but a browser cannot set an `Accept` header on a
plain link.

### GET /videos/{video_id}/aggregates · GET /videos/{video_id}/aggregates/{name}

    out   the list {video_id, aggregates[{name, about, url}]}
          one      {document, version, video_id, aggregate_id, tier,
                    inputs_fingerprint, payload, stats}
    404   this video has no aggregate of that name

One entry per *answer*: `summary`, `summary~severity` where a run split an
input, `entities:people`. `url` carries the file's stem -- `entities.people`,
since a colon cannot be in a Windows filename -- and `{name}` takes that stem.
`payload` differs per aggregator -- `stats` counts, `chapters` tiles, `ner`
lists entities. `stats` records who made it (`model`), what it read (`inputs`)
and the definition's `version`; `inputs_fingerprint` hashes the text that input
actually read plus that version, so a summary of descriptions since rewritten
can be *detected* rather than left to a reader to notice.

### GET /aggregate-definitions

    out   {prompts[{id, name, version, kind, about, instruction, fields,
                    inputs?, key?, builtin}],
           profiles[{id, name, version, about, field, identity[], story[],
                     transcript, from, threshold, rule, mutual, check,
                     min_appearances, max_narratives, instruction, fields,
                     builtin}],
           kinds[], checks[], profile_defaults{},
           inputs{default, grammar[{syntax, reads}]}, problems{}, custom_file}

A prompt runs as its name; a profile as `entities:<name>`. `problems` lists
custom entries in `data/aggregates.json` that were dropped -- shadowing a
built-in, or failing their check -- rather than raised, because one typo in a
hand-edited file taking this route down takes every form built from it too.

### POST /aggregate-prompts · DELETE /aggregate-prompts/{name}

    in    {name, kind: "fold"|"spans"|"items", instruction,
           fields: {field: {type: "text"|"list", about, of?, one_of?}},
           about?, inputs?, key?, fold_instruction?}
    out   201, the entry plus {name, version}      DELETE: 204
    409   the name is built in
    422   {"problems": [...]} -- every fault at once
    404   DELETE: no custom prompt of that name

`fields` is the answer, in describe's builder. A kind writes its own citation
keys -- `chunk_id`, `first_chunk`, `last_chunk` -- so a definition cannot
declare them. `inputs` is checked against the question vocabulary when the
prompt is written, not when a run first meets it.

### POST /link-profiles · DELETE /link-profiles/{name}

    in    {name, field, instruction, fields,
           identity?: [key], story?: [key], transcript?: false, from?: "*",
           threshold?, rule?: "max"|"q95"|"q90", mutual?: true,
           check?: "flag"|"off", min_appearances?: 2, max_narratives?: 12,
           about?}
    out   201      DELETE: 204
    409 · 422 · 404 as for prompts

`identity` names the entry keys linking embeds, and some question's shape must
have a `field` list carrying them. Without `identity` a profile links whole
values -- a text field, `summary` or `transcript` -- and must give `threshold`:
nothing in one answer is provably different from anything else, so no threshold
can be read off the video. `check: flag` has the account call name observations
that contradict the rest; they are kept and marked, never dropped. Deleting a
definition leaves the answers it wrote where they are.

### GET /videos/{video_id}/frames/{index}

    out   image/jpeg
    404   the manifest does not name that frame

`index` is the reader's count over **every** decoded frame, which is how the
manifest names it -- not a position among the kept ones, and not a second.

### GET /prompts · GET /prompts/{name}

    out   /prompts      {prompts[{name, builtin, shape, fields[], about,
                                  instruction}],
                         shapes{name: {fallback, builtin, fields[], summary}},
                         field_types[], limits{}, custom_file}
          /prompts/{n}  the same entry plus {schema, version}
    404   unknown question (with `known`)

`schema` is the exact strict JSON Schema a call would be given -- exact, not
indicative, because a call's schema depends on nothing but its question.
`version` is the hash resume is keyed on.

### POST /prompts

    in    {name, instruction, about?,
           shape?}                      name a shipped shape, or
    in    {name, instruction, about?, summary?,
           fields: {field: {type: "text"|"list", about,
                            of?: {key: description},   -- list of objects
                            one_of?: [...]}}}          -- a fixed vocabulary
    out   201, the same body `GET /prompts/{name}` returns
    409   the name is a built-in question, or a built-in shape
    422   {"problems": [...]} -- every fault at once

409 rather than 404 because the request is well-formed and the name exists:
there is nothing to correct except which name it asks for. `fields` is a
builder, not JSON Schema -- the call goes out with `strict: true`, and a schema
the model API refuses would fail after the frames are read.

Adding a question runs nothing, so it is not queued.

### DELETE /prompts/{name}

    out   204, no body
    404   no custom question of that name
    409   it is built in

Descriptions already written are untouched. One cost a paid call and records
the question it was asked, so removing the question does not make the answer
untrue -- it only stops new runs asking it.

### POST /search

    in    {query,                         required, non-empty
           video_ids?: [...],             omit for EVERY video
           video_id?,                     shorthand for a scope of one
           level?: "moment" | "video",
           moments?=5, candidates?=20,
           embedder?,                     -- provider or provider/model
           sampler?, question?, strategy?,        -- the three id filters
           chunk_ids?: [...], window?=0,          -- a set of chunks
           after?, before?,                       -- seconds
           structured?: {field: value}}           -- exact values
    out   level=moment  {query, level, scope, notes[],
                         moments: [{video_id, chunk_id, start_ts, end_ts,
                                    score, samplers[],
                                    questions {sampler_id: question},
                                    descriptions {sampler_id: text},
                                    ranks {sampler_id: {dense, text}},
                                    structured {sampler_id: {...}},
                                    notes[]}]}
          level=video   {query, level, scope,
                         videos: [{video_id, kind, content, similarity}]}
    404   nothing indexed for this embedder
    422   an empty query, an unknown level, an unknown embedder
    503   the embedder's provider has no key or cannot be reached, or
          the search_embeddings RPC is missing

An empty result is `moments: []` with top-level `notes`, not an error: "nothing
matched those filters" and "nothing indexed" are different answers and only one
is worth re-running `embed` over. The notes are top-level because an empty
result has no moment to carry them -- they used to ride only on moments, so
exactly the case they exist for reached the caller as a bare `[]`. The note
names the embedder key, since searching with an embedder that never indexed
these videos is empty in the same way.

`score` is a rank fusion, **not a similarity** -- `1/(k+best) + 0.5/(k+second)`
at k=10. There is no relevance floor, so read `ranks` beside it: measured on
this corpus a nonsense query scores 0.1136 against a real one's 0.1294, and
`text: null` is how a reader sees the lexical half was silent.

### GET /db/status · GET /db/tables · POST /db/query

    out   /status  {configured, reachable, schema, counts{table: n}}
                   or {configured, reachable: false, schema, error}
          /tables  {schema, tables[{name, about, columns[], heavy[], order[]}],
                    ops[]}
    in    /query   {table, filters?[{column, op, value}], order?, desc?,
                    limit?=50, offset?=0, include_heavy?=false}
    out   /query   {table, rows[], count, offset, limit, select}
    404   unknown table (with `known`)
    422   an unknown operator, or a column Postgres rejects -- its own message
    503   the database is not reachable

`count` is the size of the **whole** result, not the page: "20 rows" and "20 of
4,812 rows" are different answers. `select` says which columns were actually
sent, since `heavy` ones -- a 1536-wide vector, a tsvector, every word
timestamp in a file -- are withheld unless asked for.

### GET /app/

    out   the web client. `/` redirects here when `web/` exists, to `/docs`
          when it does not

## The web client

`web/` is three files a browser reads in order -- `index.html`, `app.js`,
`app.css`. No build step, no framework, one origin. `main.py` mounts it at
`/app` with `cache-control: no-cache`, so an edited file is picked up on reload
rather than served from a browser's guessed freshness lifetime.

**Nothing about the pipeline is written down in it.** Every parameter form is
generated from `/capabilities.parameters`, the legal values come from the
registries, and a blank field is *omitted* rather than sent as null so the
component's own default applies. The one widget written by hand is the
custom-shape builder, because a field is a name, a type, a description and
optionally a nested map, and a text box does not say so.

Four tabs: **Run** drives `POST /videos/{id}/run/{component}` one stage at a
time and polls the job; **Prompts** lists, builds and deletes questions;
**Search** posts `/search`; **Data** reads `/db/status` and `/db/query`.
Uploading is how `media` runs, since it is the one component the run route
cannot address.

## Reading the rows

**The read key, never the write key.** Nothing in `browse.py` writes, so
nothing in it holds a key that could.

**Columns are probed, not restated.** One `select * limit 1` per table per
process gives the deployed shape. A hard-coded list would be a second copy of
`install.sql` -- and that file is re-run against live databases precisely
because they drift. What is stated is which columns are too wide to send by
default (`embeddings.embedding` and `fts`, `transcripts.words/segments/turns`,
`cuts.scores`), which is a judgement about size rather than a claim about the
schema, so it cannot go stale the way a column list can.

**Every page carries the size of the whole result.** "20 rows" and "20 of 4,812
rows" are different answers, and a client showing the first as the second is
lying about coverage.

**`/db/status` answers rather than leaves it to be discovered.** RLS enabled
with no policy denies reads *silently* -- zero rows, no error -- so a client
that could not tell "not configured" from "nothing ingested" would show an
empty table for both.

## Why some things are the way they are

**Validation is synchronous even though the work is not.** `workflow.validate`
returns problems as a list, so a policy that needs a stream the run is not
reading is a 422 the caller sees at once rather than a job that fails a minute
later. What cannot be known without opening the file -- whether a track carries
speech -- still fails inside the job, because that is a property of the media
rather than of the request.

**The id comes from the filename, not the client.** It keys every table, every
output directory and every database row, so it is derived and sanitised
rather than accepted.

**`/videos` is read from disk, not remembered.** A restarted server still knows
everything it produced. `GET /jobs` says the converse plainly: job records die
with the process, artifacts do not.

**The export list holds what exists, not what could exist.** An audio-only
video advertises no manifest rather than offering a link that 404s -- a broken
link reads as breakage rather than as a stage that never ran.

**`?download=1` only adds a `Content-Disposition`.** Content negotiation would
be tidier, but a browser cannot set an `Accept` header on a plain link.

**A sampler may carry several questions.** `sampler=clip:[text,scene]` is one
pass over the video answering two questions about the frames it kept, and
specs naming the same sampler merge into one pass. The manifest is keyed by
run, `descriptions` and `/search` by answer (`clip:text`), so `--sampler
clip:text` narrows exactly as it did.

**A custom prompt names a shape or brings its own.** The shape carries the
response schema. `POST /prompts` takes either `shape` (a name from
`/prompts.shapes`) or `fields` -- a builder, not JSON Schema: `{"type": "text"}`
or `{"type": "list"}`, plus `of` to make each list entry an object and `one_of`
to fix the vocabulary. The schema is generated from it, because the call goes
out with `strict: true` and a raw schema the API refuses would fail after the
frames are read. `/prompts.shapes` marks each shape `builtin`, and
`field_types` and `limits` publish what a builder may contain.

Which keys identify an entry across chunks -- `clothing`, not `action` -- is
not a shape's business. A link profile names them (`POST /link-profiles`), so
the same answers can be linked by different keys without re-describing
anything.

Built-ins use exactly this vocabulary -- `yolo` is not a special case, it is the
`people` shape. A custom shape is stored under its question's name, is deleted
with it, may not take a built-in shape's name, and never claims `fallback`.
Each entry lists the `fields` it answers; two questions may answer the same
field, and both answers are kept -- a pairing is independent of every other
pairing on the chunk.

**Built-ins cannot be edited or deleted, and that is a 409 rather than a 404.**
They ship in the package so that every deployment's `yolo` means the same
thing; a request that could shadow one would make a run unreproducible from the
repo. 409 because the name exists and the request is well-formed -- there is
nothing to correct except which name it asks for. Custom questions live in
`data/prompts.json`, which the API writes and git ignores.

**Deleting a question does not touch the descriptions it produced.** A
description cost a paid call and records the question it was asked, so removing
the question does not make the answer untrue; it only stops new runs asking it.

**Scope is a set, not an argument.** `video_ids` names the videos to search and
omitting it searches every one; `video_id` is the one-element shorthand.
Searching one video, three, or all of them is the same question asked over a
different set, so it is one endpoint and a set of one is not a special case.

**Moments are keyed by `(video_id, chunk_id)`.** A chunk id is an index into
*one* video's grid, so grouping on the id alone fused chunk 0 of one video with
chunk 0 of another into a single "moment" carrying two unrelated clips -- and
the agreement bonus then scored the collision *above* either real answer. It
was invisible while the scope was one video, which is exactly why it was
written that way.

**`level` picks granularity, and never mixes the two.** `moment` ranks chunks
and honours every filter; `video` ranks whole videos by their summary out of
`video_embeddings`. One endpoint, but never one ranking: a whole-video "moment"
beside real ones is a result nobody can play. The moment filters narrow *inside*
a video, so at `level=video` they are reported back under `ignored` rather than
silently dropped.

**`/search` narrows nine ways**, and `/capabilities.search` publishes them so
a client generates its form rather than restating the list:

| | |
|---|---|
| `sampler` | one **pairing**, `clip:text` |
| `question` | one question across every sampler that asked it, `text` |
| `strategy` | one sampler's whole output, `clip` |
| `chunk_ids` | a set of chunks -- the drill-down |
| `window` | widen `chunk_ids` by N neighbours each side |
| `after` / `before` | seconds |
| `structured` | exact values, `{"severity": "severe"}` |
| `candidates` | units ranked per half before fusion |

None is a prefix match on an id: a bare `sampler_id` like `clip` means the
question *is* the strategy name, so a unit carries both halves as their own
fields. Measured across both backends, all six filters select **identical chunk
sets**; rank order differs on two, which is the lexical halves diverging rather
than a filter disagreeing.

**Time is not a field on a vector.** `after`/`before` are resolved to chunk ids
through the grid before the query, so one mechanism reaches both stores and
It needs no column and no migration, so nothing already stored becomes
unreachable.

**`structured` is only useful where a shape fixed the vocabulary with
`one_of`.** `/capabilities.search.structured_fields` lists exactly those
fields and their values, read off the shapes. On free text a filter for
`cashier` also matches `cashier or customer near checkout`.

**A moment carries the ranks each half gave it.** `ranks[sampler_id] =
{dense, text}`, and `text: null` means the lexical half was silent. Without
them a score is uninterpretable: measured on this corpus, a nonsense query
scores 0.1136 against a real one's 0.1294. There is no relevance floor, so the
ranks are the signal.

**`level=video` is Postgres only** -- that is where `aggregates` stores each
video's summary as its vector, when a run names a `database`. 4/4
correct on the test corpus.

**`/search` names its embedder.** It must be the one that built the index: a
mismatch across widths fails loudly, but two models of the same width return a
well-formed ranking that means nothing. The embedder key is in the collection
name, so a wrong name searches a collection that does not exist.
